**Space Rangers** is a side project site I am working on to showcase the advancements of humanity in regards to the exploration of outer space. While the core Vue.js code is my own writing (please be patient as I continue to learn), all data you see on the site is returned from various APIs. A vast majority of the site is fully dynamic and changes daily, based on data from other sources. Thus, the site should continue to be a fun and interesting way of keeping updated on the industry at large.

Most of the data and images you see‚Äîespecially those of planets‚Äîare taken/owned by NASA. Other media may be directly from Unsplash, Adobe Creative Cloud, SpaceX, RocketLab, or other organizations and APIs featured on the site. **I claim no ownership of these items and am only using them as assets for learning.** If you see something that needs proper attribution or I can shout out something amazing of yours, please send me a message! I love cheering on others in the industry!

I hope the site serves you well, and I am always open to thoughts and opinions.
